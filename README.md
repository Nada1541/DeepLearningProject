# Deep Learning Signature Verification Project

This project implements a Siamese Neural Network for handwritten signature verification, utilizing three different datasets. The goal is to distinguish between genuine and forged signatures.

## Datasets Used

1. **Dataset 1**: A signature dataset for real vs forged signature classification.
2. **Dataset 2**: Another signature dataset with real and forged signatures.
3. **Dataset 3**: A collection with multiple datasets containing real and forged signatures.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Grayscale images are resized and normalized.
- **Siamese Network**: Utilizes a pair of CNNs to compare two images and predict if they belong to the same class (real or forged).
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Pair Generation**: Generates pairs of images for training, validation, and testing, with labels indicating if they are from the same class.
- **Visualization**: Displays sample image pairs with their corresponding labels.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Preprocessing and Model Training**:
   - The function `preprocess_dataset` loads and preprocesses images from a given dataset.
   - `train_and_evaluate` trains the Siamese network using the prepared image pairs.
   
2. **Sample Pair Visualization**:
   - The function `show_sample_pairs_with_labels` visualizes pairs of images along with their labels for inspection.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The modelâ€™s performance is displayed after training with metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow, OpenCV, scikit-learn, matplotlib
